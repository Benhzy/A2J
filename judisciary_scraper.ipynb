At the hearingDepending on your case, you may do any of the following at the hearing:Agree to the court granting the reliefs sought, such as the order to deliver possession to the bank.Request for more time to sell your property. Request for more time to pay the remaining amount. If you managed to settle a substantial part of the amount stated in the OA before the hearing, you should inform the court how much you have paid so far and how much time you will likely need to pay the remaining amount.(If you proposed an alternative repayment scheme and it was rejected by the bank) Make a better repayment proposal to the bank. After hearing your reasons and the bank's response to your requests, the court may:Adjourn (postpone) the hearing to give you more time to make a better repayment proposal.Adjourn the hearing to give you more time to pay the remaining amount owed.Make an order for you to pay the outstanding sum of money as well as interest and the legal costs incurred by the bank and to deliver possession.If an order for possession is madeIf the court makes an order for possession, it means that the bank will be able to take possession of the mortgaged property. In some cases, the court may order the bank to give you some time before it takes possession of the mortgaged property. If the court makes such an order, the bank cannot take possession of the property until after the date and time set by the court. This is to enable you to make arrangements to move out before the bank takes possession. Note If you require more time to move out of your property and manage your affairs, you may apply to the court for an extension of time by filing a summons via eLitigation at the LawNet & CrimsonLogic Service Bureau. If the court did not order the bank to give you some time, you will be required to give possession of the mortgaged property to the bank immediately. The bank’s lawyers will usually write to inform you of the court’s order first before taking possession of the property. \n",
