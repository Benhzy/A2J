1. What do I need to ensure before applying to the Public Trustee?
You will need to ensure that the estate does not fall under one of the situations stated below where the Public Trustee cannot act.
2. What are the situations where the Public Trustee cannot act?
We cannot act if:

the estate is worth more than $50,000 (excluding Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS));

the estate has outstanding debts or liabilities;

executed in the manner required under this Act, all real estate and all personal estate which he shall be entitled to either at law or in equity at the time of his death.(2)  The power given under subsection (1) shall extend to —(a)all estates pur autre vie, whether there shall or shall not be any special occupant thereof, whether the same shall be a corporeal or an incorporeal hereditament, and whether the same shall be freehold or of any other tenure;(b)all contingent, executory or other future interests in any real or personal estate, whether the testator may or may not be ascertained as the person or one of the persons in whom the same respectively may become vested, and whether he may be entitled thereto under the instrument by which the same respectively were created or under any disposition thereof by deed or will;(c)all rights of entry for conditions broken and other rights of entry; and(d)such of the same estates, interests and rights respectively and other real and personal estates as the testator may be entitled to at the time of his death notwithstanding that he may become entitled to the same subsequently to the execution of his will.Will of infant invalid4.  No will made by any person under 21 years of age shall be valid.Rules as to formal validity5.—(1)  This section shall take effect notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act.(2)  A will shall be treated as properly executed if its execution conformed to the internal law in force —(a)in the territory where it was executed;(b)in the territory where the testator was domiciled at the time —(i)when the will was executed; or(ii)of his death;(c)in the territory where the testator habitually resided at either of the times referred to in paragraph (b); or(d)in the state of which the testator was a national at either of the times referred to in paragraph (b).(3)  Without prejudice to subsection (2), the following shall be treated as properly executed:(a)a will executed on board a vessel or an aircraft of any description, if the execution of the will conformed to the internal law in force in the territory with which, having regard to its registration (if any) and other relevant circumstances, the vessel or aircraft may be taken to have been most closely connected;(b)a will so far as it disposes of immovable property, if its execution conformed to the internal law in

would be treated as comprised in a properly executed will, if the execution of the later will conformed to any law by reference to which the revoked will or provision would be treated as properly executed;(d)a will so far as it exercises a power of appointment, if the execution of the will conformed to the law governing the essential validity of the power.(4)  A will so far as it exercises a power of appointment shall not be treated as improperly executed by reason only that its execution was not in accordance with any formal requirements contained in the instrument creating the power.(5)  In determining for the purposes of this section whether or not the execution of a will conformed to a particular law, regard shall be had to the formal requirements of that law at the time of execution, but this shall not prevent account being taken of an alteration of law affecting wills executed at that time if the alteration enables the will to be treated as properly executed.(6)  Where a law in force outside Singapore falls to be applied in relation to a will, any requirement of that law whereby special formalities are to be observed by testators answering a particular description, or witnesses to the execution of a will are to possess certain qualifications, shall be treated, notwithstanding any rule of that law to the contrary, as a formal requirement only.(7)  The construction of a will shall not be altered by reason of any change in the testator’s domicile after the execution of the will.(8)  Where under this section the internal law in force in any territory or state is to be applied in the case of a will, but there are in force in that territory or state 2 or more systems of internal law relating to the formal validity of wills, the system to be applied shall be ascertained as follows:(a)if there is in force throughout the territory or state a rule indicating which of those systems can properly be applied in the case in question, that rule shall be followed; or(b)if there is no such rule, the system shall be that with which the testator was most closely connected at the relevant time, and for this purpose the relevant time is the time of the testator’s death where the matter is to be determined by reference to circumstances prevailing at his death, and the time of execution of the will in any other case.(9)  This section shall

position of the signature of the testator, or of the person signing for him as mentioned in subsection (2), be deemed to be valid under this section if the signature shall be so placed at or after, or following, or under, or beside, or opposite to the end of the will, that it shall be apparent on the face of the will that the testator intended to give effect by such his signature to the writing signed as his will; and no such will shall be affected by the circumstance —(a)that the signature shall not follow or be immediately after the foot or end of the will;(b)that a blank space shall

witnesses;(d)that the signature shall be on a side or page or other portion of the paper or papers containing the will whereon no clause or paragraph or disposing part of the will shall be written above the signature; or(e)that there shall appear to be sufficient space on or at the bottom of the preceding side or page or other portion of the same paper on which the will is written to contain the signature.(4)  The enumeration of the circumstances under subsection (3) shall not restrict the generality of that subsection; but no signature under this Act shall be operative to give effect to any disposition or direction which is underneath or which follows it, nor shall it give effect to any disposition or direction inserted after the signature shall be made.Execution of appointment by

Act shall be valid without any other publication thereof.Will not to be invalidated by reason of incompetency of attesting witness9.  If any person who attests the execution of a will shall, at the

obliteration, interlineation or other alteration made in any will after the execution thereof shall be valid or have any effect except so far as the words or effect of the will before such alteration shall not be apparent, unless the alteration shall be executed in the like manner as by this Act is required for the execution of the will.(2)  A will referred to in subsection (1), with such alteration as part thereof, shall be deemed to be duly executed if the signature of the testator and the subscription of the witnesses be made in the margin or on some other part of the will opposite

without leaving issue”, or any other words which may import either a want or failure of issue of any person in his lifetime or at the time of his death, or an indefinite failure of his issue, shall be

will.(2)  This Act shall not extend to cases where those words referred to in subsection (1) import if no issue described in a preceding gift shall be born, or if there shall be no issue who shall live to attain the age or otherwise answer the description required for obtaining a vested estate by a preceding gift to such issue.Devise of real estate to trustee or executor24.  Where any real

surplus rents and profits thereof, shall not be given to any person for life, or the beneficial interest shall be given to any person for life, but the purposes of the trust may continue beyond the life of that person, the devise shall be construed to vest in the trustee the fee simple or other the whole legal estate which the testator had power to dispose of by will in the real estate, and not an estate determinable when the purposes of the trust shall be satisfied.Gifts to children or other issue who leave issue living at testator’s death not to lapse26.  Where any person being a child or other issue of the testator to whom any real or personal estate shall be devised or bequeathed for any estate or interest not determinable at or before the death of that person shall die in the lifetime of the testator leaving issue, and any such issue of that person shall be living at the time of the death of the testator, that devise or bequest shall not lapse, but shall take effect as if the death of that person had happened immediately after the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.Saving as to wills of soldiers and mariners27.—(1)  Notwithstanding anything in this Act, any soldier being in actual military service, or any mariner or seaman being at sea, may dispose of his personal estate as he might have done before the making of this Act and may do so even though under 21 years of age.Validity of testamentary dispositions of real property made by soldiers and sailors(2)  A testamentary disposition of any real estate made by a person to whom this section applies, and who dies after 29 August 1938 shall, notwithstanding that the person making the disposition was at the time of making it under 21 years

appointment contained in that will of any person as guardian of the infant children of the testator shall be of full force and effect.Section to extend to naval, marine and air forces(4)  This section shall extend to any member of any naval or marine forces not only when he is at sea but also when he is so circumstanced that if he were a soldier he would be in actual military service within the meaning of this section.(5)  For the purposes of this section, “soldier” includes a member of an air force and a serviceman serving in the digital and intelligence service of the Singapore Armed Forces.[Act 24 of 2022 wef 28/10/2022]Rectification of will28.—(1)  A court may order that a will be rectified so as to carry out the testator’s intentions, if the court is satisfied that, as a
