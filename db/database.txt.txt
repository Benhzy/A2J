or(b)if his presence in Singapore is unlawful under the provisions of the Immigration Act 1959 or the regulations made thereunder.Matters with respect to which court to be satisfied5.  The court before making an adoption order shall be satisfied —(a)that every person whose consent is necessary under this Act and whose consent is not dispensed with has consented to and understands the nature and effect of the adoption order for which application is made, and in particular in the case of any parent understands that the effect of the adoption order will be permanently to deprive him or her of his or her parental rights;(b)that the order if made will be for the welfare of the infant, due consideration being for this purpose given to the wishes of the infant, having regard to the age and understanding of the infant; and(c)that the applicant has not received or agreed to receive, and that no person has made or given, or agreed to make or give to the applicant, any payment or other reward in consideration of the adoption except such as the court may sanction.Terms and conditions of order6.  The court in an adoption order may impose such terms and conditions as the court may think fit and in particular may require the adopter by bond or otherwise to make for the adopted child such provision, if any, as in the opinion of the court is just and expedient.Effect of adoption order7.—(1)  Upon an adoption order being made —(a)all rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the parent or parents, guardian or guardians of the adopted child, in relation to the future custody, maintenance and education of the adopted child, including all rights to appoint a guardian or to consent or give notice of dissent to marriage shall be extinguished;(b)all such rights, duties, obligations and liabilities shall vest in and be exercisable by and enforceable against the adopter as though the adopted child was a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock; and(c)in respect of the same matters and in respect of the liability of a child to maintain its parents, the adopted child shall stand to the adopter exclusively in the position of a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock,except that in any case where 2 spouses are the adopters, such spouses shall, in respect of the matters in paragraphs (a) to (c) and for the purpose of the jurisdiction of any court to make orders as to the custody and maintenance of and right of access to children, stand to each other and to the adopted child in the same relation as they would have stood if they had been the lawful father and mother of the adopted child, and the adopted child shall stand to them respectively in the same relation as a child would have stood to a lawful father and mother respectively.(2)  Where, at any time after the making of an adoption order —(a)the adopter or the adopted person or any other person dies intestate in respect of any movable or immovable property, that property shall devolve in all respects as if the adopted person were the child of the adopter born in lawful wedlock and not the child of any other person;(b)in any disposition of movable or immovable property made, whether by instrument inter vivos or by will (including codicil) after the date of an adoption order —(i)any reference (whether express or implied) to the child or children of the adopter shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as, or as including, a reference to the adopted person;(ii)any reference (whether express or implied) to the child or children of the adopted person’s natural parents or either of them shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as not being, or as not including, a reference to the adopted person; and(iii)any reference (whether express or implied) to a person related to the adopted person in any degree shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as a reference to the person who would be related to him in that degree if he were the child of the adopter born in lawful wedlock and were not the child of any other person.(3)  Where an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child takes any interest in movable or immovable property under a disposition by the adopter or under any intestacy, or where an adopter takes any interest in movable or immovable property under a disposition by an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child, or under the intestacy of an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child, any estate or other duty which becomes leviable in respect thereof shall be payable at the same rate as if the adopted child had been a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock.(4)  For the purposes of this section, “disposition” means an assurance of any interest in property by any instrument whether inter vivos or by will including codicil.(5)  For the purposes of section 20 or 21 of the Civil Law Act 1909, a person shall be deemed to be the parent or child of the person deceased notwithstanding that he was only related to him in consequence of adoption; and accordingly in deducing any relationship which under the provisions of that section is included within the meaning of the expressions “parent” and “child” an adopted child shall be treated as being, or as having been, the legitimate offspring of his adopter.(6)  Notwithstanding anything in this section, trustees or personal representatives —(a)may convey or distribute any movable or immovable property to or among the persons entitled thereto without having ascertained that no adoption order has been made by virtue of which any person is or may be entitled to any interest therein; and(b)shall not be liable to any such person of whose claim they have not had notice at the time of the conveyance or distribution,but nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any such person to follow the property, or any property representing it, into the hands of any person, other than a purchaser, who may have received it.(7)  Where an adoption order is made in respect of a person who has been previously adopted, the previous adoption shall be disregarded for the purposes of this section in relation to the devolution of any property on the death of a person dying intestate after the date of the subsequent adoption order and in relation to any disposition of property made after that date.(8)  For the purpose of the law relating to marriage, an adopter and the person whom he has been authorised to adopt under an adoption order and all children and adopted children of the adopter shall be deemed to be within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity; and this subsection shall continue to have effect notwithstanding that some person other than the adopter is authorised by a subsequent order to adopt the same infant.(9)  An adoption order shall not by itself affect the citizenship of the adopted child.Power to make interim orders8.—(1)  Upon any application for an adoption order, the court may postpone the determination of the application and may make an interim order (which shall not be an adoption order for the purposes of this Act) giving the custody of the infant to the applicant for a period not exceeding 2 years by way of a probationary period upon such terms as regards provision for the maintenance and education and supervision of the welfare of the infant and otherwise as the court may think fit.(2)  All such consents as are required to an adoption order shall be necessary to an interim order but subject to a like power on the part of the court to dispense with any such consent.Power to make subsequent order in respect of infant already subject to an order9.  An adoption order or an interim order may be made in respect of an infant who has already been the subject of an adoption order, and, upon any application for such further adoption order, the adopter or adopters under the adoption order last previously made shall, if living, be deemed to be the parent or parents of the infant for all the purposes of this Act.Procedure10.—(1)  The Family Justice Rules Committee constituted under section 46(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 may make Family Justice Rules —(a)to prescribe any matter which may be prescribed under this Act;(b)to provide for the manner in which any application to the court is to be made, heard and determined;

and[Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](b)the country of birth of the adopted child is not proved to the satisfaction of the court, the particulars of that country may be omitted from the order and from the entry in the register maintained by the Registrar‑General.[Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](3)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](4)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](5)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](6)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](7)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](8)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](9)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](10)  The Adopted Children Register maintained under section 11 repealed by the Adoption of Children (Amendment) Act 1972 shall cease to be maintained and no extracts therefrom shall be issued except by an order of court.(11)  The Registrar-General shall keep such other registers and books, and make such entries therein as may be necessary to record and make traceable the connection between any entry in the Adopted Children Register previously maintained under section 11 repealed by the Adoption of Children (Amendment) Act 1972 and any entry in the registers of births made pursuant to this section, but the registers and books kept under this subsection shall not be, nor shall any index thereof be, open to public inspection or search nor except under an order of court shall the Registrar furnish any person with any information contained in or with any copy or extract from any such registers or books.[Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022]

requires —“annual income” means, in relation to the net estate of a deceased person, the income that the net estate might be expected at the date of the order made under this Act, when realised, to yield in a year;“court” means the General Division of the High Court or a Family Court;“death duties” means estate duty and every other duty leviable or payable on death;“net estate” means all the

expenses, debts and liabilities and estate duty payable out of his estate on his death;“Registrar” means the registrar of the Family Justice Courts;“son” and “daughter”, respectively, include a male or female child adopted by the deceased by virtue of an order made under the provisions of any written law relating to the adoption of children for the time being in force in Singapore, Malaysia or Brunei Darussalam, and also the son or daughter of the deceased en ventre sa mere at the date of the death of the deceased;“will” includes any codicil or other testamentary document.[27/2014; 40/2019]Power for court to order payment out of net estate of deceased for benefit of surviving spouse or child3.—(1)  Where, after 16 September 1966, a person dies domiciled in Singapore leaving —(a)a wife or husband;(b)a daughter who has not been married or who is, by reason of some mental or physical disability, incapable of maintaining herself;(c)an infant son; or(d)a son who is, by reason of some mental or physical disability, incapable of maintaining himself,then, if the court on application by or on behalf of any such wife, husband, daughter or son as aforesaid (referred to in this Act as a dependant of the deceased) is of opinion that the disposition of the deceased’s estate effected by his will, or the law relating to intestacy, or the combination of his will and that law, is not such as to make reasonable provision for the maintenance of that dependant, the court may order that such reasonable provision as the court thinks fit shall, subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the court may impose, be made out of the deceased’s net estate for the maintenance of that dependant:Provided that no application shall be made to the court by or on behalf of any person in any case where the disposition of a deceased’s estate effected as aforesaid is such that the surviving spouse is entitled to not less than two‑thirds of the income of the net estate and where the only other dependant or dependants, if any, is or are a child or children of the surviving spouse.(2)  The provision for maintenance to be made by an order shall, subject to subsection (4), be by way of periodical payments and the order shall provide for their termination not later than —(a)in the case of a wife or husband, her or his remarriage;(b)in the case of a daughter who has not been married, or who is under disability, her marriage or the cesser of her disability, whichever is the later;(c)in the case of an infant son, his attaining the age of 21 years;(d)in the case of a son under disability, the cesser of his disability,or in any case, his or her earlier death.(3)  Periodical payments made under subsection (2) to any one dependant shall not be at an annual rate which exceeds the annual income of the net estate, and, where payments are so made to more than one dependant in respect of the same period, the aggregate of the annual rates at which those payments are made shall not exceed the annual income of the net estate.(4)  Where the value of a deceased’s net estate does not exceed $50,000, the court shall have power to make an order providing for maintenance, in whole or in part, by way of a lump sum payment.(5)  In determining whether, and in what way, and as from what date, provision for maintenance ought to be made by an order, the court shall have regard to the nature of the property representing the deceased’s net estate and shall not order any such provision to be made as would necessitate a realisation that would be improvident having regard to the interests of the deceased’s dependants and of the person who, apart from the order, would be entitled to that property.(6)  The court shall, on any application made under this Act, have regard to any past, present or future capital or income from any source of the dependant of the deceased to whom the application relates, to the conduct of that dependant in relation to the deceased and otherwise, and to any other matter or thing which in the circumstances of the case the court may consider relevant or material in relation to that dependant, to persons interested in the estate of the deceased, or otherwise.(7)  The court shall also, on any such application, have regard to the deceased’s reasons, so far as ascertainable, for making the dispositions made by his will (if any), or for refraining from disposing by will of his estate or part of his estate, or for not making any provision, or any further provision, as the case may be, for a dependant, and the court may accept such evidence of those reasons as it considers sufficient including any statement in writing signed by the deceased and dated, so, however, that in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to any such statement the court shall have regard to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement.(8)  The court in considering for the purposes of subsection (1), whether the disposition of the deceased’s estate effected by the law relating to intestacy, or by the combination of the deceased’s will and that law, makes reasonable provision for the maintenance of a dependant shall not be bound to assume that the law relating to intestacy makes reasonable provision in all cases.Time within which application must be made4.—(1)  Except as provided by this section or section 6, an order under this Act shall not be made save on an application made within 6 months from the date on which representation in regard to the deceased’s estate is first taken out.(2)  If it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the limitation to the said period of 6 months would operate unfairly —(a)in consequence of the discovery of a will or codicil involving a substantial change in the disposition of the deceased’s estate (whether or not involving a further grant of representation);(b)in consequence of a question whether a person had an interest in the estate; or as to the nature of an interest in the estate, not having been determined at the time when representation was first taken out; or(c)in consequence of some other circumstances affecting the administration or distribution of the estate,the court may extend that period.(3)  The provisions of this Act shall not render the personal representatives of the deceased liable for having distributed any part of the estate of the deceased after the expiration of the said period of 6 months on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that the court might exercise its power to extend that period, but this subsection shall be without prejudice to any power to recover any part of the estate so distributed arising by virtue of the making of an order under this Act.(4)  In considering under this section the question when representation was first taken out, a grant limited to trust property shall be left out of account unless a grant limited to the remainder of the estate has previously been made or is made at the same time.(5)  For the purposes of sections 18(2) and 39 of the Probate and Administration Act 1934 a dependant of a deceased person by whom or on whose behalf an application made under this Act is proposed to be made shall be deemed to be a person interested in his estate.Effect and form of order5.—(1)  Where an order is made under this Act, then for all purposes, including the purposes of the enactments relating to death duties, the will or the law relating to intestacy, or both the will and the law relating to intestacy, as the case may be, shall have effect, and shall be deemed to have had effect as from the deceased’s death, subject to such variations as may be specified in the order for the purpose of giving effect to the provision for maintenance thereby made.(2)  The court may give such consequential directions as it thinks fit for the purpose of giving effect to an order made under this Act, but no larger part of the net estate shall be set aside or appropriated to answer by the income thereof the provision for maintenance thereby made than such a part as, at the date of the order, is sufficient to produce by the income thereof the amount of the said provision.(3)  An office copy of every order made under this Act shall be sent to the Registrar for entry and filing, and a memorandum of the order shall be endorsed on, or permanently annexed to, the probate or letters of administration under which the estate is being administered.Variation of orders6.—(1)  On an application made at a date after the expiration of the period specified in section 4(1), or, as the case may be, of that period as extended under section 4(2), the court may make such an order as is hereinafter mentioned, but only as respects property the income of which is at that date applicable for the maintenance of a dependant of the deceased, that is to say —(a)an order for varying the previous order on the ground that a material fact was not disclosed to the court when the order was made, or that a substantial change has taken place in the circumstances of the dependant or of a person beneficially interested in the property under the will or, as the case may be, under the law relating to intestacy; or(b)an order for making provision for the maintenance of another dependant of the deceased.(2)  An application to the court for an order under subsection (1)(a) may be made by or on behalf of a dependant of the deceased or by the trustees of the property or by or on behalf of a person beneficially interested therein under the will or, as the case may be, under the law relating to intestacy.

and(b)the applicant is unable, in spite of efforts on his or her part, to maintain himself or herself through work or from his or her property or from any other source.(2)  When ordering maintenance for the benefit of an applicant, the Tribunal must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including (but not limited to) the following matters:(a)the financial needs of the applicant, taking into account reasonable expenses for housing and medical costs;(b)the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources of the applicant, and the manner in which an applicant has spent his or her savings or dissipated his or her financial resources;(c)any physical or mental disability of the applicant;(d)the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources of the respondent;(e)the expenses incurred by the respondent in supporting his or her spouse or children;(f)the contributions and provisions, whether financial or otherwise, which the respondent has made for the maintenance of the applicant.(3)  Without prejudice to the Tribunal’s powers under the Act, the president or a deputy president of the Tribunal may, with the consent of the applicant and the respondent, make a maintenance order reflecting the terms of any agreement reached between the parties in respect of a claim, and the order is deemed to be a maintenance order made by the Tribunal under this Act and enforceable in accordance with its terms.[37/2010](4)  If the Tribunal is satisfied upon due proof that the applicant abandoned, abused or neglected the respondent, it may dismiss the application or may reduce the quantum of maintenance ordered by an amount determined by the Tribunal to be just.(5)  The onus of proving abandonment, abuse or neglect is on the respondent alleging it.(6)  Where there is more than one respondent, the Tribunal may apportion the maintenance among the various respondents in a manner determined by the Tribunal to be just.(7)  The Tribunal must, before hearing an application under this section, refer the differences between the parties to a conciliation officer for mediation between the parties.Power of Tribunal to order security for maintenance6.—(1)  A maintenance order may provide for the payment of a lump sum, or a monthly allowance or periodical payment for a period determined by the Tribunal.(2)  The Tribunal may, in its discretion, when awarding maintenance, order the respondent to secure the whole or any part of the maintenance by vesting any property in trustees upon trust to pay the whole or any part of the maintenance out of the income from that property.(3)  The Tribunal may, in awarding maintenance, order the applicant to —(a)deposit with a bank a minimum sum determined by the Tribunal;

         Pre-Adoption Briefing.Step 2 Endorsement from your home country (for non-Singapore Citizen who would like to adopt a foreign child) Non-Singapore citizens who wish to adopt a child in Singapore have to apply for a Letter of Approval to commence their Home Study Assessment. To do so, you need to obtain a Letter of Support (LOS) from your home country's Embassy/High Commission, indicating the following:
The adopters meet the requirements of adoption under the laws of your own country.The adoption in Singapore will be recognised by the adopters' home country(s).The adopted child will be granted permanent stay in the adopters' home country(s).

      Step 3 Apply for a Home Study A Home Study assesses your family's readiness to care for an adopted child. It is conducted by professional social service staff from voluntary welfare organisations accredited by MSF. If you wish to apply for a non Singapore citizen child, you need to obtain a Home Study Report first. For application of a Home Study, please refer to 
         Apply for Home Study Report. In the interest of the child, it is important that the prospective adopter(s) be assessed to be suitable and ready to adopt a child. As such, adoption applicants are only allowed to source for a child after obtaining a favourable HSR. There may be implications on the adoption application if the applicants do not adhere to this regulation. Applicants may have a foreign child under their care only after obtaining the following documents:

The Court may decide to dispense with the consent if there are special circumstances to justify this.Do note that establishing the consent from the birth parent(s) and/or the relevant person(s) will help address the risk of the adoption proceedings being contested should the birth parents gain knowledge of the adoption proceedings subsequently.You will need to provide an affidavit to Court detailing all the efforts made to locate the birth parent(s) and/or relevant person(s) via the following means:Social mediaMutual friendsRelativesLast place of residenceOther possible meansFor more information about the Consent from parents, please refer to the

How mediation is conductedMediation may be conducted in person at the MMC (Level 2, Family Justice Courts at Havelock Square) or virtually. 
Note
For virtual mediation sessions, the court will inform you via email or post that you do not need to go to court. You will also receive the details of the virtual session.
 Generally, there may be 1 to 2 mediation sessions for each case. For parties who did not reach an agreement during the first session, the second session allows them to reconsider their options and prepare the necessary documents. Note: There may be more than 2 mediation sessions in some cases, if there are valid reasons.What to bring to mediationYou may bring any documents that support your case. Some examples include:(For applicants) Forms or documents you have submitted as part of your application. (For respondents in an enforcement application) Any proof of payment made, if applicable, such as receipts or transaction slips.Note: For fresh, variation/suspension/rescission maintenance applications, both the applicant and respondent may be required to fill up a prescribed form known as a e-Template Statement (ETS) before the mediation session.During your mediation sessionThe mediator assigned to your case will conduct a private session with you and the other party. The aim is to help both parties arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution in a non-confrontational setting. The following may happen during your mediation session: You and the other party are given the opportunity to present your respective positions. You have to follow ground rules, such as taking turns to speak and not making personal attacks on each other. The mediator may use a variety of mediation tools to guide you and the other party to explore your needs and interests, as well as areas in which you may be able to come to an informed and mutually acceptable resolution.A typical mediation session takes between 45 minutes to an hour. Only parties to the case are allowed to attend.Mediation is confidential and without prejudice. The mediator will not share information that was discussed during the session with anyone else who was not involved in the mediation. Possible outcomes of the mediation sessionIf a resolution is reachedIf parties come to an agreement, the terms of the agreement will be recorded before a judge as a consent order. The matter is then concluded. Both parties must comply with the consent order.  The applicant may also choose to withdraw the application. If a resolution is not reachedIf the parties cannot come to an agreement after one or more mediation sessions, the case will proceed to a court mention before a judge.

Why is mediation important?Family disputes are typically emotionally charged, as they go to the heart of family relationships. Whether it is divorce, living and care arrangements for the child, maintenance, division of matrimonial property and assets, care of mentally incapacitated persons or distribution of a deceased's assets, when these disputes are brought to the court for    a hearing or trial, the process can be a very expensive and stressful experience for all involved. As parties will have ongoing relationships as family members, the process of litigation and eventual decision by the court may not ultimately resolve the relational aspects of the dispute.

They should do all the following:Be on time.Come prepared to negotiate in good faith and be ready to give and take.Strive to be civil at all times.        The session is not the place to make personal attacks against the other party.Consider suggestions with an open mind.Be involved in brainstorming for solutions to resolve the disputes.Share information and provide relevant documents.

What documents may be required during mediation sessions?Depending on your case, parties may have to prepare the following documents (and any other relevant documents) and bring them to their sessions (if applicable): Income tax returns, payslips and other evidence of income.A detailed list of their estimated monthly expenses and the children.Latest Central Provident Fund (CPF) statements on balances in the CPF accounts.Latest CPF statements on withdrawals for properties.

What Is A Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)

The LPA is a legal document which allows a person who is at least 21 years of age ('Donor'), to voluntarily appoint one or more persons ('Donee(s)') to make decisions and act on his/her behalf if he/she loses mental capacity one day. A Donee can be appointed to act in the two broad areas of 

   
personal welfare and property & affairs matters.​

Infographic summary on How to Make an LPA

Benefits of an LPA

Enables a person to 

      make a personal, considered choice of a trusted proxy decision maker, who is reliable and competent to act in his/her best interests should he/she lose mental capacity one day.
Alleviates the stress and difficulties faced by loved ones who need to apply for a Deputyship order, if the person loses mental capacity without an LPA in place.




You are also encouraged to make an Advance Care Plan (ACP), and appoint your Donee as your Nominated Healthcare Spokesperson. More information on ACP can be found

A Donee is able to transact on a Donor’s behalf only when the Donor has been certified by a registered medical practitioner to have lost mental capacity. All registered medical practitioners are able to provide such medical reports.


When transacting with any third party agency (e.g. banks, insurance agencies, HDB, CPFB, SLA etc.), please send the Donor’s electronic LPA to the agency via your OPGO dashboard, to ensure the latest version of the LPA is relied on.


Other supporting documents may also be required by the agency e.g. NRIC of Donee(s), doctor’s medical report certifying Donor’s loss of mental capacity to manage his/her affairs. Click 

         
here​ for a sample of the medical report. 
An individual’s loss of mental capacity may be temporary or permanent. If the Donor regains capacity, the Donee must step aside for the Donor to make his own decisions. The LPA remains valid and can be used should the Donor lose mental capacity again.​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

What is a Deputy?
A Deputy is appointed by the court to make certain decisions on behalf of a person who lacks mental capacity when the person has not made a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) and has no Donee to decide on his behalf in respect of those decisions. A Deputy can be an individual or a licensed trust company under the Trust Companies Act (Cap.336), as prescribed by the Mental Capacity Regulations.
For persons without next of kin or suitable next of kin, Professional Deputies may apply to be their Deputies.
​​Parents may also apply to court to appoint themselves as Deputies for their children who lack mental capacity. A successor Deputy may also be appointed in the event where Deputies are unable to act due to loss of mental capacity themselves, or death.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​About the Professional Deputies and Donees Scheme
The Mental Capacity (Registration of Professional Deputies) Regulations 2018 came into effect on 1 September 2018, allowing professional deputies to act for persons who lack mental capacity (known as 'P') for remuneration. Professional deputies must be unrelated to P.
The Professional Deputies and Donees (PDD) scheme aims to serve individuals, who may not have family members or close friends to rely on;​​​ to be their proxy decision makers. 
The role of a professional deputy is an important one, in which the professional deputy must be prepared to make key decisions affecting P’s property & affairs and personal welfare. Professionals registered under this scheme come from selected professional groups (i.e. lawyers, doctors, accountants, allied health professionals, nurses and social workers). ​
 
How are Professional Deputies appointed?  
Professional Deputies can apply to Court to act for individuals who have lost mental capacity and include the (i) P-focused plan and (ii) Schedule of Assets as part of the application. Individuals with mental capacity can also choose to make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), and appoint a Professional Deputy to act as a Donee. Professional Donee is required to submit the (i) P-focused plan, (ii) Donor’s latest Schedule of Assets and (iii) Medical report within 2 months after the LPA comes into force​. Professional Deputies are to submit P-focused plans as supporting documents when submitting the annual Deputy Report.

Family Guidance Order

With effect from 1 July 2020, the court order for a Child or Young Person (CYP) who is labelled as "Beyond Parental Control" has been renamed the "Family Guidance Order" (FGO) to emphasise the importance of the family and support CYPs with behavioural concerns.
An FGO is issued to CYPs who are below 16 years of age and display serious behavioural challenges that parents might apply for the Youth Court's assistance. 
Parents who wish to apply for an FGO must first arrange for an appointment to undergo a Pre-FGO screening with the appointed Agencies. The Agencies are Singapore Children's Society or Epworth Community Services. 
Parents and the CYP will subsequently be referred to a mandatory family programme conducted by either of the appointed agencies and they must complete the programme before parents can apply for an FGO in Youth Court.
If issues between the CYP and parents are not resolved despite the mandatory family programme, parents may proceed to make an FGO application* through the agencies. The agency will assess the application and make recommendations to the Court on intervention options. 
The Court may decide to mandate the family to undergo the mandatory family programme, order the CYP and their family to undergo a social investigation or dismiss the case.
As part of the FGO, the Court can also order to place the CYP under statutory supervision or admit him/her into a Home gazetted under the Children and Young Persons Act for a period not exceeding three years.
The FGO is reserved for CYPs with very serious behavioural issues. If the CYPs' behavioural concerns are assessed to be of low risk, parents may wish to reach out to the nearest Family Service Centres or youth agencies for support. From 1 October 2021, parents can now use this Link

 to register for an appointment with either one of the pre-FGO agencies 

(Epworth Community Services or Singapore Children’s Society).  You will 

need

 to log in using your Singpass. Alternatively you may wish to contact Singapore Children's Society or Epworth Community Services directly to

 register for an appointment. 
* Withdrawal of an FGO application filed will require the Court's approval.

Family Guidance Order

With effect from 1 July 2020, the court order for a Child or Young Person (CYP) who is labelled as "Beyond Parental Control" has been renamed the "Family Guidance Order" (FGO) to emphasise the importance of the family and support CYPs with behavioural concerns.
An FGO is issued to CYPs who are below 16 years of age and display serious behavioural challenges that parents might apply for the Youth Court's assistance. 
Parents who wish to apply for an FGO must first arrange for an appointment to undergo a Pre-FGO screening with the appointed Agencies. The Agencies are Singapore Children's Society or Epworth Community Services. 
Parents and the CYP will subsequently be referred to a mandatory family programme conducted by either of the appointed agencies and they must complete the programme before parents can apply for an FGO in Youth Court.
If issues between the CYP and parents are not resolved despite the mandatory family programme, parents may proceed to make an FGO application* through the agencies. The agency will assess the application and make recommendations to the Court on intervention options. 
The Court may decide to mandate the family to undergo the mandatory family programme, order the CYP and their family to undergo a social investigation or dismiss the case.
As part of the FGO, the Court can also order to place the CYP under statutory supervision or admit him/her into a Home gazetted under the Children and Young Persons Act for a period not exceeding three years.
The FGO is reserved for CYPs with very serious behavioural issues. If the CYPs' behavioural concerns are assessed to be of low risk, parents may wish to reach out to the nearest Family Service Centres or youth agencies for support. From 1 October 2021, parents can now use this Link

 to register for an appointment with either one of the pre-FGO agencies 

(Epworth Community Services or Singapore Children’s Society).  You will 

need

 to log in using your Singpass. Alternatively you may wish to contact Singapore Children's Society or Epworth Community Services directly to

 register for an appointment. 
* Withdrawal of an FGO application filed will require the Court's approval.

Page ContentMaintenance of Parents Act
The Maintenance of Parents Act allows Singapore residents aged 60 years and above - who are unable to provide for themselves - to claim maintenance from their children who are capable of supporting them, but are not doing so. Parents can claim maintenance, in the form of monthly allowances or a lump-sum payment.
You may access Singapore Statutes Online​ for the Maintenance of Parents Act and the Maintenance of Parents Rules.
Maintenance of Parents Act Amendments
The Commissioner of the Maintenance of Parents (CMP) will be doing more to help resolve maintenance disputes amicably.
In the spirit of preserving family ties, the Act will prioritise conciliation over legal action.
The changes were implemented with effect from 15 March 2011, after Parliament passed amendments to the Maintenance of Parents Bill in November 2010.
The Amendments Bill was tabled by Marine Parade MP Seah Kian Peng.
Key amendments
Measures to Encourage and Strengthen Conciliation
a) You will receive more help to resolve your maintenance issues with your children without having to file a Maintenance Order against them. The Commissioner will strive for conciliation and will only advise you to file your claim and redirect your case to the Tribunal as a last resort.
Previously, parents could choose to file a claim against their children directly with the Tribunal without trying conciliation.
b) You can achieve a written agreement for resolved cases. The maintenance agreement can be made into an enforceable Maintenance Order by the Tribunal, with the consent of both you and your children.
c) The Commissioner and Tribunal can get information from gazetted government agencies to assess if your children have the means to provide for you. The information accessed will be treated with confidentiality and will not be circulated without permission from you or your children.
d) Your children and you must attend conciliation sessions. You can make use of the sessions to work out issues and arrive at a settlement without legal action. Failure to appear for conciliation sessions may be taken into consideration by the Tribunal during the hearing of the maintenance application.
Measures to Streamline Processes
a) Up to four Deputy Presidents may be appointed to process cases faster. In the absence of the President, the Deputy Presidents may preside over Tribunal hearings, accompanied by two Tribunal members. More frequent hearings can help reduce the time taken for adjudication.
b) Multiple or vexatious claims can be dismissed. If claims are repeatedly made without sufficient grounds, the President and Deputy Presidents of the Tribunal may do away with a full Tribunal sitting if they decide to dismiss claims. This prevents abuse of the process by individuals who make multiple maintenance applications. Appeals against such decisions may be made to the full Tribunal.
c) Medical cost is now taken into consideration. The Tribunal takes into consideration the applicant's medical cost when deciding the amount of maintenance to be awarded.
Historical Background
To provide a safety net for needy and neglected parents who are unable to support themselves, then Nominated Member of Parliament Associate Professor Walter Woon proposed a bill in Parliament, on 23 May 1994 to enact the law for the maintenance of parents.
The move was met with varying opinions from the public and Members of Parliament.
After the Bill's second reading in July 1994, it was sent to an 11-member Select Committee. The Committee submitted its findings and amended Bill, with a key recommendation to set up a Tribunal to administer the law.
On 2 November, 1995, the Maintenance of Parents Bill was passed in Parliament.

msf_conciliation-process https://www.msf.gov.sg/maintenanceofparents/Pages/ConciliationProcess.aspx
Page ContentConciliation ProcessConciliation at the Commissioner's Office is the 

      first step to resolving maintenance issues between parents and children.Step 1: ConsultationA Conciliation Officer will go through the maintenance issues with the parent or representative of the parent. He will contact the children for conciliation when the parent wishes to do so. If the parent does not know where the children are, the Conciliation Officer will attempt to trace them. The parent may be referred to other agencies for assistance if the children cannot be traced for conciliation. Step 2: ConciliationMore than one session of conciliation may take place and separate sessions may be helpful if both parties do not wish to attend together.A joint session is meant to help both parties understand each other and work through their issues. This may be the first time that the parent and children are hearing each others side of the story. Hopefully, the children will realise that their parents need their help while the parents may understand that children have their own needs to meet too. How long each case takes depends on how many children are involved and how complex the maintenance issues are. A simple case can be settled within a month, while a complex one may take up to 3 months. More time will be needed to locate long-lost children and get them to attend conciliation sessions. Step 3: AgreementIf the parent and children manage to agree on an arrangement, they will sign a memorandum with the agreed terms, including the amount, date and mode of contribution. This can be made into an order endorsed by the Tribunal, if both parent and children decide to do so. With an endorsed order, the parent can go to the Family Court if the child fails to keep to the agreement. With an unendorsed agreement, the parent can file a formal claim at the Tribunal if the child fails to keep to the agreement. To set an appointment for conciliation, you can contact the Office of the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents. Call

Page ContentMediation
When parents file for a Maintenance Order against their children, a mediation session will be fixed for all parties to go for mediation in the Tribunal.
Mediation aims to help parents and children arrive at a settlement. A mediator is assigned within 4 weeks of the Notice of Application to mediate between parents and children.
If mediation results in a settlement, both parents and children can endorse a maintenance agreement prepared by the mediator. From this, a consent order can be made by the Tribunal.
If mediation does not result in a settlement, both parents and children will have to attend the Tribunal hearing for an order to be made.
Who are the mediators?
They are professional mediators from the Singapore Mediation Centre and the Eagles Mediation & Counselling Centre.
Is the mediator neutral?
Yes, the mediator is a neutral third party who will guide both parents and children to negotiate and resolve issues.
The mediator does not decide, recommend, assess or give advice. He acts purely on the wishes of both parties for a fair settlement.
How does mediation work?
During the process of mediation, the mediator will meet with the parties jointly and individually to work towards resolution of the maintenance issue. It may be necessary for the mediator to include information obtained from other sources/persons after consultation with both parties.
What do I have to tell the mediator?
You must be honest and provide complete information and documents that the mediator requires. If full and honest disclosure is not made during the course of mediation, any agreement entered into during mediation may not be valid.
Is mediation confidential?
Yes. Details of mediation sessions and all communications between both parties and the mediator are strictly confidential.

 Generally, there may be 1 to 2 mediation sessions for each case. For parties who did not reach an agreement during the first session, the second session allows them to reconsider their options and prepare the necessary documents.

The following may happen during your mediation session: You and the other party are given the opportunity to present your respective positions. You have to follow ground rules, such as taking turns to speak and not making personal attacks on each other. The mediator may use a variety of mediation tools to guide you and the other party to explore your needs and interests, as well as areas in which you may be able to come to an informed and mutually acceptable resolution.A typical mediation session takes between 45 minutes to an hour. Only parties to the case are allowed to attend.Mediation is confidential and without prejudice. The mediator will not share information that was discussed during the session with anyone else who was not involved in the mediation. Possible outcomes of the mediation sessionIf a resolution is reachedIf parties come to an agreement, the terms of the agreement will be recorded before a judge as a consent order. The matter is then concluded. Both parties must comply with the consent order.  The applicant may also choose to withdraw the application. If a resolution is not reachedIf the parties cannot come to an agreement after one or more mediation sessions, the case will proceed to a court mention before a judge.

Why is mediation important?Family disputes are typically emotionally charged, as they go to the heart of family relationships. Whether it is divorce, living and care arrangements for the child, maintenance, division of matrimonial property and assets, care of mentally incapacitated persons or distribution of a deceased's assets, when these disputes are brought to the court for    a hearing or trial, the process can be a very expensive and stressful experience for all involved. As parties will have ongoing relationships as family members, the process of litigation and eventual decision by the court may not ultimately resolve the relational aspects of the dispute.

How can parties prepare for their mediation    sessions?Parties should go to their sessions with reasonable proposals in order to start the process. They should do all the following:Be on time.Come prepared to negotiate in good faith and be ready to give and take.Strive to be civil at all times.        The session is not the place to make personal attacks against the other party.Consider suggestions with an open mind.Be involved in brainstorming for solutions to resolve the disputes.Share information and provide relevant documents.

What documents may be required during mediation sessions?Depending on your case, parties may have to prepare the following documents (and any other relevant documents) and bring them to their sessions (if applicable): Income tax returns, payslips and other evidence of income.A detailed list of their estimated monthly expenses and the children.Latest Central Provident Fund (CPF) statements on balances in the CPF accounts.Latest CPF statements on withdrawals for properties.

executed in the manner required under this Act, all real estate and all personal estate which he shall be entitled to either at law or in equity at the time of his death.(2)  The power given under subsection (1) shall extend to —(a)all estates pur autre vie, whether there shall or shall not be any special occupant thereof, whether the same shall be a corporeal or an incorporeal hereditament, and whether the same shall be freehold or of any other tenure;(b)all contingent, executory or other future interests in any real or personal estate, whether the testator may or may not be ascertained as the person or one of the persons in whom the same respectively may become vested, and whether he may be entitled thereto under the instrument by which the same respectively were created or under any disposition thereof by deed or will;(c)all rights of entry for conditions broken and other rights of entry; and(d)such of the same estates, interests and rights respectively and other real and personal estates as the testator may be entitled to at the time of his death notwithstanding that he may become entitled to the same subsequently to the execution of his will.Will of infant invalid4.  No will made by any person under 21 years of age shall be valid.Rules as to formal validity5.—(1)  This section shall take effect notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act.(2)  A will shall be treated as properly executed if its execution conformed to the internal law in force —(a)in the territory where it was executed;(b)in the territory where the testator was domiciled at the time —(i)when the will was executed; or(ii)of his death;(c)in the territory where the testator habitually resided at either of the times referred to in paragraph (b); or(d)in the state of which the testator was a national at either of the times referred to in paragraph (b).(3)  Without prejudice to subsection (2), the following shall be treated as properly executed:(a)a will executed on board a vessel or an aircraft of any description, if the execution of the will conformed to the internal law in force in the territory with which, having regard to its registration (if any) and other relevant circumstances, the vessel or aircraft may be taken to have been most closely connected;(b)a will so far as it disposes of immovable property, if its execution conformed to the internal law in force in the territory where the property was situated;(c)a will so far as it revokes a will which under this Act would be treated as properly executed or revokes a provision which under this Act would be treated as comprised in a properly executed will, if the execution of the later will conformed to any law by reference to which the revoked will or provision would be treated as properly executed;(d)a will so far as it exercises a power of appointment, if the execution of the will conformed to the law governing the essential validity of the power.(4)  A will so far as it exercises a power of appointment shall not be treated as improperly executed by reason only that its execution was not in accordance with any formal requirements contained in the instrument creating the power.(5)  In determining for the purposes of this section whether or not the execution of a will conformed to a particular law, regard shall be had to the formal requirements of that law at the time of execution, but this shall not prevent account being taken of an alteration of law affecting wills executed at that time if the alteration enables the will to be treated as properly executed.(6)  Where a law in force outside Singapore falls to be applied in relation to a will, any requirement of that law whereby special formalities are to be observed by testators answering a particular description, or witnesses to the execution of a will are to possess certain qualifications, shall be treated, notwithstanding any rule of that law to the contrary, as a formal requirement only.(7)  The construction of a will shall not be altered by reason of any change in the testator’s domicile after the execution of the will.(8)  Where under this section the internal law in force in any territory or state is to be applied in the case of a will, but there are in force in that territory or state 2 or more systems of internal law relating to the formal validity of wills, the system to be applied shall be ascertained as follows:(a)if there is in force throughout the territory or state a rule indicating which of those systems can properly be applied in the case in question, that rule shall be followed; or(b)if there is no such rule, the system shall be that with which the testator was most closely connected at the relevant time, and for this purpose the relevant time is the time of the testator’s death where the matter is to be determined by reference to circumstances prevailing at his death, and the time of execution of the will in any other case.(9)  This section shall not apply to a will of a testator who died before 26 June 1992 and shall apply to a will of a testator who dies after that date whether the will was executed before or after that date.Mode of execution6.—(1)  No will shall be valid unless it is in writing and executed in the manner mentioned in subsection (2).(2)  Every will shall be signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction, and the signature shall be made or acknowledged by the testator as the signature to his will or codicil in the presence of 2 or more witnesses present at the same time, and those witnesses shall subscribe the will in the presence of the testator, but no form of attestation shall be necessary.(3)  Every will shall, as far only as regards the position of the signature of the testator, or of the person signing for him as mentioned in subsection (2), be deemed to be valid under this section if the signature shall be so placed at or after, or following, or under, or beside, or opposite to the end of the will, that it shall be apparent on the face of the will that the testator intended to give effect by such his signature to the writing signed as his will; and no such will shall be affected by the circumstance —(a)that the signature shall not follow or be immediately after the foot or end of the will;(b)that a blank space shall intervene between the concluding word of the will and the signature;(c)that the signature shall be placed among the words of the testimonium clause or of the clause of attestation, or shall follow or be after or under the clause of attestation, either with or without a blank space intervening, or shall follow or be after, or under, or beside the names or one of the names of the subscribing witnesses;(d)that the signature shall be on a side or page or other portion of the paper or papers containing the will whereon no clause or paragraph or disposing part of the will shall be written above the signature; or(e)that there shall appear to be sufficient space on or at the bottom of the preceding side or page or other portion of the same paper on which the will is written to contain the signature.(4)  The enumeration of the circumstances under subsection (3) shall not restrict the generality of that subsection; but no signature under this Act shall be operative to give effect to any disposition or direction which is underneath or which follows it, nor shall it give effect to any disposition or direction inserted after the signature shall be made.Execution of appointment by will7.—(1)  No appointment made by will, in exercise of any power, shall be valid, unless the will is executed in the manner required by this Act.(2)  Every will executed in the manner required by this Act shall, so far as respects the execution and attestation thereof, be a valid execution of a power of appointment by will, notwithstanding that it shall have been expressly required that a will made in exercise of that power should be executed with some additional or other form of execution or solemnity.Publication of will not necessary8.  Every will executed in the manner required by this Act shall be valid without any other publication thereof.Will not to be invalidated by reason of incompetency of attesting witness9.  If any person who attests the execution of a will shall, at the time of the execution thereof or at any time afterwards, be incompetent to be admitted a witness to prove the execution thereof, the will shall not on that account be invalid.Gifts to attesting witness or to wife or husband of attesting witness to be void10.—(1)  If any person attests the execution of any will to whom or to whose wife or husband any beneficial devise, legacy, estate, interest, gift or appointment of or affecting any real or personal estate, other than and except charges and directions for the payment of any debt, shall be thereby given or made, the devise, legacy, estate, interest, gift or appointment shall, so far only as concerns the person attesting the execution of the will, or the wife or husband of that person, or any person claiming under that person or wife or husband, be utterly null and void.(2)  The attesting witness referred to in subsection (1) shall be admitted as a witness to prove the execution of the will or to prove the validity or invalidity thereof, notwithstanding the devise, legacy, estate, interest, gift or appointment mentioned in the will.(3)  The attestation of a will by a person to whom or to whose spouse there is given or made any disposition as is described in subsection (1) shall be disregarded for the purposes of that subsection if the will is duly executed without his attestation and without that of any other such person.(4)  Subsection (3) shall apply to the will of any person dying after 29 May 1992, whether executed before or after 29 May 1992.Creditor attesting a will charging estate with debts to be admitted a witness11.  In case by any will any real or personal estate shall be charged with any debt, and any creditor, or the wife or husband of any creditor, whose debt is so charged, shall attest the execution of the will, the creditor notwithstanding the charge shall be admitted a witness to prove the execution of the will or to prove the validity or invalidity thereof.Executor not incompetent to be witness12.  No person shall, on account of his being an executor of a will, be incompetent to be admitted a witness to prove the execution of the will or to prove the validity or invalidity thereof.Will to be revoked by marriage except in certain cases13.—(1)  Every will made by a man or woman shall be revoked by his or her marriage, except a will made in exercise of a power of appointment, when the real or personal estate thereby appointed would not in default of such appointment pass to his or her heir, executor or administrator or the person entitled under the Intestate Succession Act 1967.(2)  Notwithstanding subsection (1), where a will made on or after 29 August 1938 is expressed to be made in contemplation of a marriage, the will shall not be revoked by the solemnisation of the marriage contemplated; and this subsection shall apply notwithstanding that the marriage contemplated may be the first, second or subsequent marriage of a person lawfully practising polygamy.No will to be revoked by presumption from altered circumstances14.  No will shall be revoked by any presumption of an intention on the ground of an alteration in circumstances.Revocation of will or codicil15.  No will or codicil, or any part thereof, shall be revoked otherwise than —(a)as provided in section 13;(b)by another will or codicil executed in the manner by this Act required;(c)by some writing declaring an intention to revoke it, and executed in the manner in which a will is by this Act required to be executed; or(d)by the burning, tearing, or otherwise destroying the will by the testator, or by some person in his presence and by his direction, with the intention of revoking it.Effect of obliteration, interlineation or alteration16.—(1)  No obliteration, interlineation or other alteration made in any will after the execution thereof shall be valid or have any effect except so far as the words or effect of the will before such alteration shall not be apparent, unless the alteration shall be executed in the like manner as by this Act is required for the execution of the will.(2)  A will referred to in subsection (1), with such alteration as part thereof, shall be deemed to be duly executed if the signature of the testator and the subscription of the witnesses be made in the margin or on some other part of the will opposite or near to the alteration or at the foot or end of or opposite to a memorandum referring to the alteration and written at the end or some other part of the will.Revival of revoked will17.—(1)  No will or codicil, or any part thereof, which shall be in any manner revoked, shall be revived otherwise than by the re‑execution thereof, or by a codicil executed in the manner required by this Act and showing an intention to revive the will or codicil.(2)  When any will or codicil which shall be partly revoked, and afterwards wholly revoked, shall be revived, the revival shall not extend to so much thereof as shall have been revoked before the revocation of the whole thereof, unless an intention to the contrary be shown.Subsequent conveyance or other acts not to prevent operation of will18.  No conveyance or other act made or done subsequently to the execution of a will of or relating to any real or personal estate therein comprised, except an act by which the will shall be revoked as aforesaid, shall prevent the operation of the will with respect to the estate or interest in the real or personal estate as the testator shall have power to dispose of by will at the time of his death.Will to be construed to speak from death of testator19.  Every will shall be construed with reference to the real estate and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.Residuary devises to include estates comprised in lapsed and void devises20.  Unless a contrary intention appears by the will, such real estate and interest therein as is comprised or intended to be comprised in any devise in the will contained, which fails or is void by reason of the death of the devisee in the lifetime of the testator or by reason of the devise being contrary to law or otherwise incapable of taking effect, shall be included in the residuary devise (if any) contained in the will.General gift of realty and of personality to include property over which testator has general power of appointment21.—(1)  A general devise of the real estate of the testator, or of the real estate of the testator in any place or in the occupation of any person mentioned in his will, or otherwise described in a general manner, shall be construed to include any real estate, or any real estate to which that description shall extend, as the case may be, which he may have power to appoint in any manner he may think proper, and shall operate as an execution of that power, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.(2)  A bequest of the personal estate of the testator, or any bequest of personal estate described in a general manner, shall be construed to include any personal estate, or any personal estate to which that description shall extend, as the case may be, which he may have power to appoint in any manner he may think proper, and shall operate as an execution of that power, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.Devise without words of limitation22.  Where any real estate shall be devised to any person without any words of limitation, the devise shall be construed to pass the fee simple or other the whole estate or interest which the testator had power to dispose of by will in the real estate unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.Construction of words importing want or failure of issue23.—(1)  In any devise or bequest of real or personal estate, the words “die without issue” or “die without leaving issue”, or any other words which may import either a want or failure of issue of any person in his lifetime or at the time of his death, or an indefinite failure of his issue, shall be construed to mean a want or failure of issue in the lifetime or at the time of the death of that person, and not an indefinite failure of his issue, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.(2)  This Act shall not extend to cases where those words referred to in subsection (1) import if no issue described in a preceding gift shall be born, or if there shall be no issue who shall live to attain the age or otherwise answer the description required for obtaining a vested estate by a preceding gift to such issue.Devise of real estate to trustee or executor24.  Where any real estate shall be devised to any trustee or executor, the devise shall be construed to pass the fee simple or other the whole estate or interest which the testator had power to dispose of by will in the real estate, unless a definite term of years, absolute or determinable, or an estate of freehold, shall thereby be given to him expressly or by implication.Devise of real estate to trustee without limitation25.  Where any real estate shall be devised to a trustee, without any express limitation of the estate to be taken by the trustee, and the beneficial interest in such real estate, or in the surplus rents and profits thereof, shall not be given to any person for life, or the beneficial interest shall be given to any person for life, but the purposes of the trust may continue beyond the life of that person, the devise shall be construed to vest in the trustee the fee simple or other the whole legal estate which the testator had power to dispose of by will in the real estate, and not an estate determinable when the purposes of the trust shall be satisfied.Gifts to children or other issue who leave issue living at testator’s death not to lapse26.  Where any person being a child or other issue of the testator to whom any real or personal estate shall be devised or bequeathed for any estate or interest not determinable at or before the death of that person shall die in the lifetime of the testator leaving issue, and any such issue of that person shall be living at the time of the death of the testator, that devise or bequest shall not lapse, but shall take effect as if the death of that person had happened immediately after the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.Saving as to wills of soldiers and mariners27.—(1)  Notwithstanding anything in this Act, any soldier being in actual military service, or any mariner or seaman being at sea, may dispose of his personal estate as he might have done before the making of this Act and may do so even though under 21 years of age.Validity of testamentary dispositions of real property made by soldiers and sailors(2)  A testamentary disposition of any real estate made by a person to whom this section applies, and who dies after 29 August 1938 shall, notwithstanding that the person making the disposition was at the time of making it under 21 years of age or that the disposition has not been made in such manner or form as was on 29 August 1938 required by law, be valid in any case where the person making the disposition was of such age and the disposition has been made in such manner and form that if the disposition had been a disposition of personal estate made by that person it would have been valid.Power to appoint testamentary guardians(3)  Where any person dies after 29 August 1938 having made a will which is, or which, if it had been a disposition of property, would have been rendered valid by this section, any appointment contained in that will of any person as guardian of the infant children of the testator shall be of full force and effect.Section to extend to naval, marine and air forces(4)  This section shall extend to any member of any naval or marine forces not only when he is at sea but also when he is so circumstanced that if he were a soldier he would be in actual military service within the meaning of this section.(5)  For the purposes of this section, “soldier” includes a member of an air force and a serviceman serving in the digital and intelligence service of the Singapore Armed Forces.[Act 24 of 2022 wef 28/10/2022]Rectification of will28.—(1)  A court may order that a will be rectified so as to carry out the testator’s intentions, if the court is satisfied that, as a consequence of either or both of the following, the will is so expressed that the will fails to carry out the testator’s intentions:(a)a clerical error;(b)a failure to understand the testator’s instructions.[16/2016](2)  Except with the permission of a court, an application for an order under subsection (1) must be made no later than 6 months after the date on which a grant authorising the administration of the testator’s estate is first made.[16/2016](3)  Where the personal representatives of the testator distribute, after the end of the period of 6 months referred to in subsection (2), any part of the testator’s estate —(a)this section does not render the personal representatives liable for making that distribution on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that a court may permit the making of an application for an order under subsection (1) after the end of that period; but(b)this subsection does not affect any power to recover, by reason of the making of an order under subsection (1), any part of the testator’s estate that is so distributed.[16/2016](4)  The following grants are to be disregarded when considering, for the purposes of this section, when a grant authorising the administration of the testator’s estate is first made:(a)a grant limited to settled land or to trust property;(b)any other grant that does not permit the distribution of the testator’s estate;(c)a grant limited to a part only of the testator’s estate, unless a grant limited to the remainder of the testator’s estate has previously been made or is made at the same time.[16/2016](5)  For the purposes of this section, where a grant consists of any probate, or letters of administration with the will annexed, sealed under section 47(1) of the Probate and Administration Act 1934, the grant is deemed to be made on the date of sealing of the probate or letters of administration with the will annexed.[16/2016](6)  The Family Justice Rules Committee constituted under section 46(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 may make Family Justice Rules —(a)to regulate and prescribe the procedure and practice to be followed in any application for an order under subsection (1); and(b)to provide for any matter relating to any such procedure or practice.[16/2016](7)  In this section —“court” means the General Division of the High Court or a Family Court;“grant” means any of the following:(a)any probate granted by the General Division of the High Court or a Family Court, or granted before 1 January 2015 by a District Court;(b)any letters of

administration with the will annexed, sealed under section 47(1) of the Probate and Administration Act 1934;“letters of administration with the will annexed” and “probate” have the same meanings as in section 2 of the Probate and Administration Act 1934.[16/2016; 40/2019]
