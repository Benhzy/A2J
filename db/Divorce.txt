An application for divorce is a legal procedure to end a marriage.

You and your spouse may file a divorce application on a simplified track if both parties can agree on all of the following before court papers are filed:

The divorce.
All ancillary matters related to the divorce.
This includes children's care arrangements (if applicable), maintenance (the amount of financial support) given to the spouse and children and the division of matrimonial assets.
If parties cannot agree on any of the matters relating to the divorce before the court papers are filed, they will have to file a divorce application on a normal track.

In order to be eligible to apply for a divorce in the Family Courts, you or your spouse must meet the following requirements:

Be a Singapore citizen or have been living in Singapore for 3 continuous years immediately prior to the filing of a divorce application.
Have been married for at least 3 years.
