Parties should weigh the pros and cons before proceeding. Find out what you should consider before enforcing an ECT order.Enforcement of ECT ordersTo enforce an ECT order, you may file a single enforcement application for one or more methods of enforcement. If you do not know what assets the other party has, you may consider applying for an order for examination of enforcement respondent.

    it is worthwhile to enforce the order.

What enforcement meansEmployment Claims Tribunals (ECT) orders may be enforced in the same way as District Court orders. This means that if
    you obtain an ECT order in your favour and the other party does not fulfil their obligations under the order, you may take enforcement actions against the other party. Deciding to enforce an orderThe ECT does not initiate the enforcement of an order in favour of a party. The party who wishes to enforce the order must initiate the enforcement process.Enforcing an order does not guarantee an outcome. Parties should weigh the pros and cons before proceeding. Find out what you should consider before enforcing an ECT order.Enforcement of ECT ordersTo enforce an ECT order, you may file a single enforcement application for one or more methods of enforcement. If you do not know what assets the other party has, you may consider applying for an order for examination of enforcement respondent. This allows you to find out what assets the defaulting party has, so you can decide whether
    it is worthwhile to enforce the order.

Are interns covered under the Employment Claims Act?Interns who are engaged under a contract of service will be covered under the Employment Claims Act and may bring their claims before the ECT.

I am below 18 years old. Can I file a claim in ECT?If you are below 18 years old and have gone through TADM mediation for your claim, you can proceed to file a claim in the ECT if you are represented by a parent or guardian.

I am above 18 years old but below 21 years old. Can I file a claim at the ECT?Yes. Under Section 36 of the Civil Law Act, you may file a claim at the ECT, or defend, conduct or intervene in ECT proceedings.

Why is there a limit on the claim amount?Setting a limit on the claim amount helps to ensure that the dispute resolution process at the ECT remains quick and affordable. It also encourages parties to file their claims early, rather than allowing the claims to accumulate over    time.

I abandoned the excess claim amount to enable my case to be heard at the ECT. However, the amount for one of my claims was reduced during my ECT proceedings. Can I request that the ECT add the amount of the other claims which were abandoned    earlier? No. The ECT will only consider the claim amount indicated in your claim form. You will not be allowed to add the amount of other claims that were earlier abandoned.

What enforcement meansEmployment Claims Tribunals (ECT) orders may be enforced in the same way as District Court orders. This means that if
    you obtain an ECT order in your favour and the other party does not fulfil their obligations under the order, you may take enforcement actions against the other party. Deciding to enforce an orderThe ECT does not initiate the enforcement of an order in favour of a party. The party who wishes to enforce the order must initiate the enforcement process.Enforcing an order does not guarantee an outcome. Parties should weigh the pros and cons before proceeding. Find out what you should consider before enforcing an ECT order.Enforcement of ECT ordersTo enforce an ECT order, you may file a single enforcement application for one or more methods of enforcement. If you do not know what assets the other party has, you may consider applying for an order for examination of enforcement respondent. This allows you to find out what assets the defaulting party has, so you can decide whether
    it is worthwhile to enforce the order.
