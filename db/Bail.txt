 What is bailWhen an accused person is arrested, they are usually held in custody until dealt with by a court. However, an arrested person may be released from custody if a sum of money, known as bail, is provided to guarantee that they will turn up in court.The person who posts bail is called a bailor (also known as a surety). The bailor agrees to provide security for the bail amount ordered by the court. If the accused complies with all of the court's directions, the bail amount will be returned    to the bailor after the case is concluded.The bailor has to ensure the accused attends court and complies with other bail conditions. This is a very serious responsibility. If the accused fails to attend court, the bailor may lose all the money or personal belongings deposited as security.
