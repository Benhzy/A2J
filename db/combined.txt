or(b)if his presence in Singapore is unlawful under the provisions of the Immigration Act 1959 or the regulations made thereunder.Matters with respect to which court to be satisfied5.  The court before making an adoption order shall be satisfied —(a)that every person whose consent is necessary under this Act and whose consent is not dispensed with has consented to and understands the nature and effect of the adoption order for which application is made, and in particular in the case of any parent understands that the effect of the adoption order will be permanently to deprive him or her of his or her parental rights;(b)that the order if made will be for the welfare of the infant, due consideration being for this purpose given to the wishes of the infant, having regard to the age and understanding of the infant; and(c)that the applicant has not received or agreed to receive, and that no person has made or given, or agreed to make or give to the applicant, any payment or other reward in consideration of the adoption except such as the court may sanction.Terms and conditions of order6.  The court in an adoption order may impose such terms and conditions as the court may think fit and in particular may require the adopter by bond or otherwise to make for the adopted child such provision, if any, as in the opinion of the court is just and expedient.Effect of adoption order7.—(1)  Upon an adoption order being made —(a)all rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the parent or parents, guardian or guardians of the adopted child, in relation to the future custody, maintenance and education of the adopted child, including all rights to appoint a guardian or to consent or give notice of dissent to marriage shall be extinguished;(b)all such rights, duties, obligations and liabilities shall vest in and be exercisable by and enforceable against the adopter as though the adopted child was a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock; and(c)in respect of the same matters and in respect of the liability of a child to maintain its parents, the adopted child shall stand to the adopter exclusively in the position of a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock,except that in any case where 2 spouses are the adopters, such spouses shall, in respect of the matters in paragraphs (a) to (c) and for the purpose of the jurisdiction of any court to make orders as to the custody and maintenance of and right of access to children, stand to each other and to the adopted child in the same relation as they would have stood if they had been the lawful father and mother of the adopted child, and the adopted child shall stand to them respectively in the same relation as a child would have stood to a lawful father and mother respectively.(2)  Where, at any time after the making of an adoption order —(a)the adopter or the adopted person or any other person dies intestate in respect of any movable or immovable property, that property shall devolve in all respects as if the adopted person were the child of the adopter born in lawful wedlock and not the child of any other person;(b)in any disposition of movable or immovable property made, whether by instrument inter vivos or by will (including codicil) after the date of an adoption order —(i)any reference (whether express or implied) to the child or children of the adopter shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as, or as including, a reference to the adopted person;(ii)any reference (whether express or implied) to the child or children of the adopted person’s natural parents or either of them shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as not being, or as not including, a reference to the adopted person; and(iii)any reference (whether express or implied) to a person related to the adopted person in any degree shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as a reference to the person who would be related to him in that degree if he were the child of the adopter born in lawful wedlock and were not the child of any other person.(3)  Where an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child takes any interest in movable or immovable property under a disposition by the adopter or under any intestacy, or where an adopter takes any interest in movable or immovable property under a disposition by an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child, or under the intestacy of an adopted child or the spouse or issue of an adopted child, any estate or other duty which becomes leviable in respect thereof shall be payable at the same rate as if the adopted child had been a child born to the adopter in lawful wedlock.(4)  For the purposes of this section, “disposition” means an assurance of any interest in property by any instrument whether inter vivos or by will including codicil.(5)  For the purposes of section 20 or 21 of the Civil Law Act 1909, a person shall be deemed to be the parent or child of the person deceased notwithstanding that he was only related to him in consequence of adoption; and accordingly in deducing any relationship which under the provisions of that section is included within the meaning of the expressions “parent” and “child” an adopted child shall be treated as being, or as having been, the legitimate offspring of his adopter.(6)  Notwithstanding anything in this section, trustees or personal representatives —(a)may convey or distribute any movable or immovable property to or among the persons entitled thereto without having ascertained that no adoption order has been made by virtue of which any person is or may be entitled to any interest therein; and(b)shall not be liable to any such person of whose claim they have not had notice at the time of the conveyance or distribution,but nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any such person to follow the property, or any property representing it, into the hands of any person, other than a purchaser, who may have received it.(7)  Where an adoption order is made in respect of a person who has been previously adopted, the previous adoption shall be disregarded for the purposes of this section in relation to the devolution of any property on the death of a person dying intestate after the date of the subsequent adoption order and in relation to any disposition of property made after that date.(8)  For the purpose of the law relating to marriage, an adopter and the person whom he has been authorised to adopt under an adoption order and all children and adopted children of the adopter shall be deemed to be within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity; and this subsection shall continue to have effect notwithstanding that some person other than the adopter is authorised by a subsequent order to adopt the same infant.(9)  An adoption order shall not by itself affect the citizenship of the adopted child.Power to make interim orders8.—(1)  Upon any application for an adoption order, the court may postpone the determination of the application and may make an interim order (which shall not be an adoption order for the purposes of this Act) giving the custody of the infant to the applicant for a period not exceeding 2 years by way of a probationary period upon such terms as regards provision for the maintenance and education and supervision of the welfare of the infant and otherwise as the court may think fit.(2)  All such consents as are required to an adoption order shall be necessary to an interim order but subject to a like power on the part of the court to dispense with any such consent.Power to make subsequent order in respect of infant already subject to an order9.  An adoption order or an interim order may be made in respect of an infant who has already been the subject of an adoption order, and, upon any application for such further adoption order, the adopter or adopters under the adoption order last previously made shall, if living, be deemed to be the parent or parents of the infant for all the purposes of this Act.Procedure10.—(1)  The Family Justice Rules Committee constituted under section 46(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 may make Family Justice Rules —(a)to prescribe any matter which may be prescribed under this Act;(b)to provide for the manner in which any application to the court is to be made, heard and determined;

and[Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](b)the country of birth of the adopted child is not proved to the satisfaction of the court, the particulars of that country may be omitted from the order and from the entry in the register maintained by the Registrar‑General.[Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](3)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](4)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](5)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](6)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](7)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](8)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](9)  [Deleted by Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022](10)  The Adopted Children Register maintained under section 11 repealed by the Adoption of Children (Amendment) Act 1972 shall cease to be maintained and no extracts therefrom shall be issued except by an order of court.(11)  The Registrar-General shall keep such other registers and books, and make such entries therein as may be necessary to record and make traceable the connection between any entry in the Adopted Children Register previously maintained under section 11 repealed by the Adoption of Children (Amendment) Act 1972 and any entry in the registers of births made pursuant to this section, but the registers and books kept under this subsection shall not be, nor shall any index thereof be, open to public inspection or search nor except under an order of court shall the Registrar furnish any person with any information contained in or with any copy or extract from any such registers or books.[Act 17 of 2021 wef 29/05/2022]

Why is mediation important?Family disputes are typically emotionally charged, as they go to the heart of family relationships. Whether it is divorce, living and care arrangements for the child, maintenance, division of matrimonial property and assets, care of mentally incapacitated persons or distribution of a deceased's assets, when these disputes are brought to the court for    a hearing or trial, the process can be a very expensive and stressful experience for all involved. As parties will have ongoing relationships as family members, the process of litigation and eventual decision by the court may not ultimately resolve the relational aspects of the dispute.

How can parties prepare for their mediation    sessions?Parties should go to their sessions with reasonable proposals in order to start the process. They should do all the following:Be on time.Come prepared to negotiate in good faith and be ready to give and take.Strive to be civil at all times.        The session is not the place to make personal attacks against the other party.Consider suggestions with an open mind.Be involved in brainstorming for solutions to resolve the disputes.Share information and provide relevant documents.

What documents may be required during mediation sessions?Depending on your case, parties may have to prepare the following documents (and any other relevant documents) and bring them to their sessions (if applicable): Income tax returns, payslips and other evidence of income.A detailed list of their estimated monthly expenses and the children.Latest Central Provident Fund (CPF) statements on balances in the CPF accounts.Latest CPF statements on withdrawals for properties. Valuation reports for properties that they own. Documents showing cash payments towards the properties.Documents showing outstanding mortgage.Documents showing payments towards housing renovations.
